"{\"industry_info\": {\"industry\": \"Industrials\", \"industry_id\": \"20\", \"subindustry\": \"Marine\", \"subindustry_id\": \"20303010\"}, \"industry_summary\": {\"industry_summary\": \"Dallas, located in a landlocked region of Texas, does not have direct access to oceans or significant large bodies of water suitable for traditional fishing boat charters. However, if such a business were to operate in the surrounding lakes, it could face several climate change impacts. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could affect water levels in nearby lakes and reservoirs, impacting the availability and abundance of fish. Higher temperatures might lead to increased evaporation rates, reducing water levels and potentially leading to warmer water temperatures unsuitable for some fish species. Additionally, extreme weather events such as droughts and heavy rainfall, which have occurred in Texas, including Dallas, over the past decade, could further alter lake ecosystems, impacting fish populations and water quality. These factors could disrupt the supply of fish, alter charter schedules, and increase operational costs for cooling systems and fuel. Furthermore, climate change may exacerbate the occurrence of harmful algal blooms, posing health risks and potential regulatory challenges. Therefore, a fishing boat charter service in Dallas would need to adapt by diversifying services, enhancing sustainability practices, and investing in robust planning to manage such climate-related risks.\"}, \"locations_results\": {\"analyses\": []}, \"risk_results\": [{\"risk\": \"Rising Sea Levels\", \"mitigation\": \"Invest in ships that can handle higher sea levels and have safety measures
